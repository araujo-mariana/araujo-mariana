### About Me

I'm proficient in Portuguese (C2), English (C1), Spanish and French (B1), and have basic knowledge of German, Korean, and Japanese (A1). Additionally, I have familiarity with Italian, Latin, Chinese, Norwegian, Russian, Swiss, and Danish. My background in theater has enhanced my public speaking skills, enabling me to communicate impactfully and motivate others with confidence. Despite being introverted, I possess strong social skills and thrive in collaborative environments.

I have a deep love for animals and play three musical instruments. Arts are integral to my life, shaping my ability to recognize patterns and generate both visual and intellectual insights. I enjoy studying a wide range of subjects, from mathematical sciences and philosophy to humanities and natural sciences, which sharpens my analytical capabilities and broadens my cultural perspectives.

### Mission

As a developer and designer, I believe in the power of creativity and engineering to transform ideas into effective solutions. By merging creativity with rationality, I aim to create impactful and user-centric designs that enhance cognitive and intellectual development through intuitive software experiences.

### What I'm Seeking

I am eager to engage in challenging projects to gain market experience without prioritizing immediate financial returns. I am looking to collaborate on diverse projects and expand my knowledge in frontend and full-stack development, as well as data analysis. My passion lies in statistics, probabilistic calculations, and pattern recognition.

### Current Focus

I am pursuing a degree in Software Engineering with a specialization in the psychology of design and disruptive technologies. My goal is to explore how our vision can contribute to cognitive and intellectual growth through user-focused software. Currently, I am working on several projects with my university teams:

1. **Gamified eLearning Platform for Languages:** Developing an innovative language learning website with research phases, testing with student volunteers, and interface design. The project includes defining the name, objectives, persona, personality, and branding. Our team comprises three developers, with three potential collaborators.
2. **Intelligent Animal Adoption Search App:** An application to streamline the process of finding animals in need of adoption.
3. **Gamified Time Management App for ADHD:** Targeted at users aged 10-18, this app focuses on helping manage time effectively.
4. **Intelligent Transportation App:** A smart solution for managing transportation needs.
5. **Sales Tracking App:** An application designed to efficiently track and manage sales activities.
